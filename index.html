                  <a href="info/zeon.html">Zeon</a>,
                  stands at the forefront of the 
                  <a href="info/universal_century.html">Universal Century</a>'s
                  ongoing struggle for autonomy. Neo Zeon represents the zenith

                  that have reshaped the socio-political fabric of the Universal Century.
                  It is the vanguard of change, challenging the old guard and catalyzing 
                  a new era in human civilization.
