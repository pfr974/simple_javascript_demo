        Zeon Zum Deikun was a philosopher who developed Contolism:
        which was both about Elseim (that Earth is sacred, and mankind was always meant
        to leave it and live in space) and Sideism (all space colonies should be independent
        from the Earth Federation). He was also the creator of the Newtype theory,
        which believed that humans, who have needed to communicate with each other
        throughout time, would eventually develop a sixth sense to mentally communicate.
